# **SQL for Data Analysis — Final Project**

This project was developed as part of the course **“SQL for Data Analysis: Advanced SQL Querying Techniques”**.  

It showcases advanced SQL skills, including table JOINs (inner, outer, self, cross), window functions, subqueries, and common table expressions (CTEs). It also includes the use of numeric, datetime, string, and NULL functions.

## **Project structure**
- **`create_statements_mysql.sql`** – SQL script to create and populate a MySQL database with MLB dataset.  
- **`final_project.sql`** – A set of SQL queries showcasing functionality and techniques I learned throughout the course.  
- **`data_quality_checks`** – folder containing SQL scripts I wrote to assess data quality for each table and identify potential issues.  
  - These checks were used to filter out invalid data during analysis.

## **How to run the project**
1. **Create a new database** in MySQL.  
2. **Run** `create_statements_mysql.sql` to set up the schema and load the MLB dataset.  
3. **Execute** the data quality checks to review the dataset’s integrity.  
4. **Run** `final_project.sql` to perform the analysis and review the results.
